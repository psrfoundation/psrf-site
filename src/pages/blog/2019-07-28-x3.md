Our goals were exceedingly surpassed during the Pyramid of Penguins Campaign that was held at Convention. Together, Phi Rho sisters and friends raised over $15,000 in donations for LEAP programming. This is equivalent to the amount approved for this year’s Convention grant and what is projected for next year’s Conference! Congratulations to the top three chapters:

1. Purdue - Alpha
2. Ohio State – Beta
3. Dayton – Gamma

Thank you to everyone for your support and generous donations! You’re truly helping us build the future!
