In celebration of Phi Sigma Rho’s 35th anniversary, the Foundation is hosting the Founder’s Day of Giving campaign. The Foundation asks that you help us celebrate this milestone by donating $35 or $350 to the Foundation.  As the sorority expands, the Foundation needs your help to continue to meet the needs of our growing chapters through scholarships, LEAP grants, and endowments. Donations can be made online or through Venmo at @PSRFoundation.
