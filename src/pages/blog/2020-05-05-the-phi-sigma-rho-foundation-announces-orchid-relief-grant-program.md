  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation has created
  the Orchid Relief Grant program. The purpose of these grants is to provide
  one-time emergency grants, subject to the availability of funds, to initiated
  undergraduate and graduate members who are experiencing financial hardship due
  to the COVID-19 virus crisis. Grants are to be used to fund expenses to
  continue education for the current school year (2019-2020).

From now until June 15th, actives and alumnae pursuing degrees in the current or upcoming term who have been financially impacted by COVID-19 should complete the online application found under the Grants tab above. Grants of up to $500 will be given in one payment to approved applicants upon receipt of complete application, supporting materials and approval by the Grant Committee. Applications will be accepted and considered on a rolling basis until the program's end on June 15th, 2020 or until funds are exhausted. 

In honor of Giving Tuesday Now, a global day of giving as an emergency response to the unprecedented need caused by COVID-19, we encourage you to support the Orchid Relief Grant program today by donating to the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation's General Fund. The link can also be found under the Grants tab above. It is the hope of the Foundation that with more funds available, more sisters will be helped through the Orchid Relief Grants.
