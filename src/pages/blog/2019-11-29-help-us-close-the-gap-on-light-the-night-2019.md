We are less than **$4,000** away from our Light the Night fundraising goal!  

We have currently raised a total of **$34,049!**  Donating even a small gift today will make us one step closer to raising the last **$3,951** needed to reach our **2019 fundraising goal of $38,000** for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society on behalf of Phi Sigma Rho! 

Our teams are SO CLOSE to meeting our 2019 fundraising goal, so we ask that you please support your chapter’s team by going to https://pages.lls.org/ltn/2019/phisigmarho. Please contact Devin Stanke, Philanthropy Chair, for more information on how to donate.
