It is our privilege to announce that starting next year, the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation will be providing **SIX** scholarship opportunities to its members, with the recent addition of the **Francis J. Monigan Memorial Scholarship** and **Anne Louise Roach Legacy Scholarship**. These scholarships mark special moments in time for our incredible donor families, and the Foundation is honored to be a part of their legacies. Thank you to  the alumnae behind these scholarships, Heather Monigan (Dayton - Gamma) and Jennifer Roach (Purdue - Alpha).

Be on the lookout for more information on these scholarships. Applications will be released in **October 2019** and are always due on **March 1, 2020**.
