With the new year coming, our 2018 End of Year Campaign is wrapping up. The Foundation set a goal of raising $9,000, and thanks to our generous donors, we've met over half of this goal. The funds raised during this campaign will go toward funding scholarships for exceptional sisters, supporting grants to the Sorority for LEAP sessions at the Conference and Convention, and providing resources to help chapters and alumnae support our philanthropy.

Did you miss the deadline for the End of Year Campaign? Donations can still be made through our website. The Foundation would like to thank all of its generous donors and wishes everyone a Safe and Happy New Year!
