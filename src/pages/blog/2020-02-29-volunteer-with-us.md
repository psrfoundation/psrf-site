Are you creative, organized, and always on social media? Are you detail oriented, love scholarship, and love learning about our sistersâ€™ goals and successes? Want to give back to the sisterhood through volunteering? Volunteer with the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation. We are actively looking for volunteers to serve on the 2020 scholarship committee and publicity committee. If you are interested or would like more information, please contact Lexi Heironimus via email at secretary@phisigmarhofoundation.org.
