Do you find yourself routinely shopping off the Amazon app on your Android device? If so, be sure to update your settings to default to Amazon Smile in support of the Foundation. For every purchase you make, AmazonSmile donates 0.5% on qualified purchases to the nonprofit of your choice, at no extra cost to you. This can be a big difference for the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation so be sure to update your settings now! You can find the instructions to do so here. Be sure to share this with your spouse, family, and friends so they can set this up on their apps as well to make an even bigger impact.  Take advantage of such an easy way to give back to the Foundation while you shop!
