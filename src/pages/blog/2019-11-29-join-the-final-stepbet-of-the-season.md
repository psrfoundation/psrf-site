Join in on the game today! Download the StepBet app and search game code "PhiSigmaRho" to join. The initial bet is $40 and if you meet your step goals for 6 weeks, you'll be a winner! At the end of the game, 60% of the pot will be donated to the Foundation, 30% will go to the winners, and StepBet will keep 10%. If you win, you are guaranteed at least your $40 back. 

This is a great way to hold yourself accountable to your fitness goals during the holidays, or gain extra credit for things like walking to class or joining the Light the Night Walks! This challenge is open to all Phi Rhos, friends and family so get your group together today!
