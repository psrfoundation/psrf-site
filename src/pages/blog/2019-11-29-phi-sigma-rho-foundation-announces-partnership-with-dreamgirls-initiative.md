Starting in Spring 2020, this partnership will provide service and leadership opportunities for active and alumnae organizations of Phi Sigma Rho to support the next generation of women in engineering through engineering-focused programming for middle school girls. These programs will be transferable to schools, Scout troops, community shelters, and more!  Additional details and information will be coming out soon about how both actives and alumnae can get involved in this partnership.

**What is The DreamGirls Initiative?**

Founded in 2015 by Phi Sigma Rho Co-Founder, Rashmi Drummond, The DreamGirls Initiative is a nonprofit focused  on exposing middle school girls to female role models and their careers through a variety of hands-on events.  This program is committed to inspiring young women in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) through day long “Dream Days” and after-school “DreamGirls in Action” programming. These programs differentiate themselves by putting career paths first, instead of focusing on STEM skills alone.  For many girls, it doesn't really matter if you like building a bridge if you can’t connect the skills behind bridge making to a meaningful career that would utilize these interests and skills. The standout feature of these programs is the focus of female role models for participants through corporate involvement and hands-on programming.
