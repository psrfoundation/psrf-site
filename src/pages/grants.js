              <h1>Leadership and Educational Programming Grants</h1>
              <p>Phi Sigma Rho has been dedicated to developing the next generation of women engineers. Funding leadership development is just one way the Foundation works to achieve its mission and vision. Thanks in part to generous donations made to the Leadership Education and Programming (LEAP) Fund, the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation has been able to gift grants to fund LEAP sessions to develop Phi Rhos into bold leaders, strong women, and supportive sisters in support!</p>
              <p>Leadership Education and Programming impacts more sisters each year than any other program.  Nearly 500 sisters have been LEAP certified through Phi Sigma Rho, with over 750 sisters having attended at least one program.</p>

              <p>Your contributions to the LEAP Fund of the Phi Sigma Rho Foundation allows for more grants towards LEAP programming. This support goes a long way in securing impactful keynote speakers, new programs and trainings, and better breakout sessions to reach more Phi Rhos each year.</p>
